# framer-carousel
Simple, swipable card carousel built in Framer.js, using the restaurant recommendation app Ness as an example. Handles as many cards as you'd like. Prototype at http://share.framerjs.com/vlg18n8b4uuq/.

Thank you to Sean Mateer (https://medium.com/@sean_mateer) for his original tutorial on creating a 2-card prototype, and to Andrew Suciu, Tim Maslyn, and Emily Maslyn for their help and advice on extending it to n cards.
